## Recommendify
This is a web app made with react, that uses the spotify API to search for artists, songs and albums.
You can choose a combination of up to 5 artists and songs and get a "radio" or recommended playlist based on the combination.

If it's too unintuitive, there is a button in bottom right corner where you can see your chosen combination and get the recommendation.
